Before running the application, first start PostgreSQL:

`./gradlew startPostgresContainer`

and then start the Grails App:

`./gradlew bootRun`

If you connect to the database, you will see the expected database schema.

== bootRun depends on PostgreSQL

You could configure the `bootRun` task to depends on the `startPostgresContainer` task adding the following to `build.gradle`:

`bootRun.dependsOn startPostgresContainer`

This will create the next dependency path:

`bootRun -> startPostgresContainer -> createPostgresContainer -> pullPostgresImage`

Such a path may be of interest for a continuous integration environment.
