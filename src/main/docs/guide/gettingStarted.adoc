If you do any real Grails Development, you will need to connect to external services; Databases, services such as ElasticSearch, Redis etc.

Usually, you needed to install those services on your development machine to replicate production environments. You could
be in scenarios such as developing on MacOS a Grails application which connects to MSSQL database. Installing such external services could be difficult
or impossible in your development environment.

Among many other things, Docker can help us simplify such a scenario. In this Guide, you will write a Grails application which connects to a PostgreSQL database
running on a docker container. You will not install Postgres on your machine. Instead, you will pull a PostgreSQL image, create and container with that image and
start the container. You will modify your Grails application to connect to the PostgreSQL database which runs in the container.
